# kh-bad-word-bot

This bot will post an image of Berseker or whatever in response to if a certain word is detected within a message.

# How To Use

1. Make sure you have NodeJS installed. If not, install it.

2. Download or git clone this code to your PC 

3. Open the "badWordBot.js" file. Go to the line that says (var token= "";). Place the Bot User Token inside the quotes and save it.

4. Navigate to the folder in cmd or Shift + Right-Click in the folder to open a command line window (Or just Right-Click > "Git Bash Here" if you have Git Bash installed)

5. In the command line, type "npm install discord.js". Ignore the warnings.

6. In the command line, type "node badWordBot.js" and hit Enter (Pardon me camel-casing a file name, I derped)

7. If it says "Logged in as [Bot name]" then it should be running! If there's a login failure, try regenerating the token.

# Current word list as of V 1.0 is:

* n*****r
